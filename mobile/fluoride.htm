                  <h2>Does Fluoride Really Make a Difference?</h2>
                        <p><img src="images/FluorideSmile.jpg" width="125" height="83" align="right" alt="fluoride" vspace="5" hspace="10" border="1" />In 
                          the past, cavities were a fact of life. But over the 
                          last several years tooth decay has been reduced dramatically 
                          due to fluoride. Fluoride is beneficial for adults as 
                          well as children. Research has shown that fluoride reduces 
                          cavities by up to 40% in children and 35% in adults.<b>* 
                          </b></p>
                  <h2>Is Fluoride Safe?</h2>
                  <p>Yes. Numerous studies over the past 60 years have shown that 
                    fluoride at recommended levels is not only safe, but provides 
                    significant health benefits.*</p>
                  <h2>How Does Fluoride Help Children?</h2>
                        <p>Children benefit from fluoride both <b>systemically</b> (by 
                          ingesting fluoride) and <b>topically</b> (the fluoride 
                          that gets on their teeth). Systemic and topical fluoride 
                          work together to keep teeth strong. Fluoride works best 
                          in children while teeth are forming. This helps both 
                          primary (baby) and permanent teeth. Starting at birth, 
                          and until all permanent teeth have fully erupted, ingested 
                          fluoride helps strengthen teeth as they are forming. 
                          Topical fluoride helps people of all ages. Fluoride 
                          is the only known substance that will actually strengthen 
                          teeth and make them harder. </p>
                        <h2>Does My Child Need Fluoride Supplements?</h2>
                        <p>Most city water is fluoridated and is an adequate source 
                          of systemic (ingested) fluoride. If your family uses 
                          well water or bottled water, you should have your water 
                          tested to see if there is adequate natural fluoride, 
                          or if a fluoride supplement is needed. Check with your 
                          local Health Department or bottled water manufacturer 
                          for testing. If adequate fluoride is not present, your 
                          child may need a prescription fluoride supplement from 
                          your dentist.</p>
                        <p>Topical fluoride is provided by fluoridated toothpastes 
                          and rinses. Additional fluoride treatments are applied 
                          as needed by your dentist during regular check-ups.</p>
                        <h2>Does Fluoride Benefit Adults, Too?</h2>
    <p>Yes! Topical fluoride helps people of all ages by stopping 
                          the progression of a newly formed cavity and preventing 
                          root cavities. Fluoride is also helpful for patients 
                          with sensitive teeth. A consistent daily use of topical 
                          fluoride will often dramatically decrease tooth sensitivity 
                          to hot and cold substances. At your regular check-up, 
                          we will evaluate your particular situation to determine 
                          if additional fluoride treatments are needed.                        </p>
