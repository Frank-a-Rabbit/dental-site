                        <p align="left"><strong><a href="https://clearcorrect.com/" target="_blank">ClearCorrect</a></strong> is the clear and simple choice. No wires. No brackets. Just clear, convenient comfort—every reason to smile. </p>
                        <p align="left">With ClearCorrect, your dentist or orthodontist can straighten your teeth using a series of clear, custom, removable aligners. Each aligner moves your teeth just a little bit at a time until you eventually get straight teeth. </p>
                        <h2 align="left">How does it work? </h2>
                        <p align="left">You and your doctor will evaluate your teeth and talk about any problems or goals you have for your smile. Once you and your doctor establish ClearCorrect is the right treatment option for you, your doctor will take impressions, photos, and x-rays of your teeth that ClearCorrect uses in manufacturing your custom aligners. Then your doctor writes a prescription for your custom aligners and sends it to ClearCorrect. </p>
                        <h2 align="left">What can it do? </h2>
                        <p align="left">ClearCorrect can treat a wide variety of issues that keep people from achieving their ideal smiles. Straighter teeth don't just look better; they work better too. Poorly-aligned teeth can interfere with bite function, wear out quicker, and are more prone to cavities. Ask your doctor how ClearCorrect can help you. </p>

                        <h2>What 
                          is Orthodontics?</h2>
                  <p>When describing orthodontics, most people just refer to <a href="#braces">braces</a>. 
                    While the majority of orthodontic cases involve braces, there 
                    are alternatives that may be used for younger children or 
                    adults. <a href="#arch">Arch expanders</a> for younger children 
                    can minimize or eliminate the need for braces when the problem 
                    is treated early enough. <a href="#NoBraces">Invisible, clear 
                    plastic retainers</a>, instead of braces, can be used by adults 
                    for mild to moderate crowding problems.</p>
                  <h2>What are the Benefits of Orthodontics?</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Reduce the risk of injury - prominent teeth are more prone 
                      to <a href="accidents.htm">trauma</a></li>
                    <li>Reduce the risk of <a href="cavities.htm">decay</a> - 
                      crooked teeth are harder to clean</li>
                    <li>Reduce the risk of developing <a href="jaw.htm">TMJ problems</a></li>
                    <li>Eliminate the <a href="worn.htm">excessive wear</a> on 
                      your teeth that can be caused by a poorly aligned bite</li>
                    <li>Straight teeth provide a healthier, more attractive smile</li>
                    <li>A beautiful smile increases your confidence and self-esteem</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2>What is an Orthodontic Evaluation?</h2>
                  <p>Orthodontic treatment with braces begins with an evaluation 
                    appointment. <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/dds1.lbi" -->Dr. Fattahi<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> will first visually determine if you are a good candidate 
                    for orthodontic treatment, or if another treatment would be 
                    more appropriate. If you are a good candidate for orthodontic 
                    treatment, <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/dds1.lbi" -->Dr. Fattahi<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> will take impressions of your teeth, special x-rays of your 
                    jaw joint, head and teeth, and very important measurements 
                    of your teeth and mouth.</p>
                        <p><img src="images/ortho2.jpg" width="125" height="94" align="right" alt="consult " vspace="5" hspace="10" border="1" />Next 
                          is a consulting appointment to discuss the treatment 
                          plan. The treatment plan is based on the records taken 
                          at the evaluation. The consult includes:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Specific treatment recommendation</li>
                    <li>Expected length of treatment</li>
                    <li>Expected cost of treatment</li>
                  </ul>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>When should My Child be Evaluated? </h2>
                        <p>If your child develops an &quot;open 
                    bite&quot;, or you are otherwise concerned about the development 
                    of your child's teeth, no matter what the age, contact us 
                    right away for a consultation with <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/dds1.lbi" -->Dr. Fattahi<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> . 
                    Otherwise, children should be evaluated by the age of 6 for 
                    orthodontic treatment. In the past, a child was 11 or 12 before 
                    brackets were actually placed on the teeth to straighten them. 
                    This may still hold true in most cases, but there are new 
                    techniques that can correct problems early, while a child 
                    is still growing. This may eliminate the need for braces in 
                    the future, or if the child does still need braces, the treatment 
                    will be less complicated, usually shortening the period of 
      time in braces.</p>

                  <h2>What is an Arch Expander?</h2>
                        <p><img src="images/ortho3.jpg" width="100" height="60" align="left" alt="arch expander" vspace="5" hspace="10" border="1" />An<b> 
                          Arch Expander</b> is one example of orthodontic treatment 
                          available for younger patients. Many times an arch expander 
                          can be used to create a proper alignment of the arches 
                          so permanent teeth have room to erupt in a natural position. 
                          The use of an arch expander will generally minimize 
                          or eliminate the need for braces when the patient gets 
                          older.</p>
                  <p><a name="braces" id="braces"></a></p>
                  <h2>What are Braces? </h2>
                  <p><b>Braces</b> are retainers, bonded brackets, arch wires 
                    and elastic bands that move crowded or spaced teeth into a 
                    &quot;normal&quot; position for appearance, prevention and function. 
                    Patients with poorly aligned teeth tend to have much more 
                    tooth decay, gum disease and jaw joint problems. Recently 
                    invented brackets and new techniques make orthodontic treatment 
                    faster and more comfortable than ever.</p>

                          brackets with elastic bands. The slight tension on the 
                          wire is gently transferred to the bracket through the

                          anymore. Many adults are turning to braces to correct 
                          problems with their bite. They recognize the benefits 
                          of reduced <a href="worn.htm">wear</a>, reduced incidence 
                          of <a href="jaw.htm">TMJ problems</a>, and increased

                          technique for adults to obtain the results of braces 
                          without wearing braces! This technique, which is effective 
                          only for mild to moderate crowding, utilizes a series 
                          of retainers (computer generated or lab constructed) 
                          that are worn sequentially until the desired correction
