                  <p>Are you unsatisfied with the color, shape, length of your teeth? Are your teeth thin and constantly chipping? Are your teeth worn down due to years of grinding? If you said yes to any of these situations, dental veneers might be a good fit for you! </p>
                  <p><strong><u>What are veneers?</u></strong><br />
                    Dental veneers are a custom made shell that covers your existing tooth to change the cosmetic appearance of the tooth. Veneers are often made out of porcelain but can also be made from a resin composite. Unlike dental crowns that cover the whole tooth, dental veneers only cover the front of the tooth. </p>
                  <p><strong><u>How are veneers made?</u></strong><br />
                    Dental veneers are often done in at least 3 appointments with your dentist - consultation, prepping for the veneer, and applying the veneer. However, depending on your dentist's policies and your case it could be more or less dental office visits. </p>
                  <p>At your first appointment, your dentist will evaluate the health of your teeth. Here, you will talk to your dentist about what you don't like about your teeth and about what you would like them to look like. You may have x-rays and dental impressions taken at this appointment. </p>
                  <p>At your second appointment, your dentist will prepare your tooth for your veneers. This may or may not require anesthetic depending on the areas that are being prepped. Your dentist will make a model of your teeth, which is typically sent to a dental lab to be made. Your dentist will make and place temporary veneers on your tooth/teeth. </p>
                  <p>At the third appointment, your temporary veneers are taken off and your permanent ones are cemented on. Some adjustments may be made to the veneer structure or your gums at this point. Once everything is permanently put on, you will continue to make a few post-op, follow up appointments to make sure the veneers are looking good and that you are happy with things like shape and shade. </p>
                  <p><strong><u>Pros to veneers</u></strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Appearance is very natural looking if done correctly. </li>
                    <li> Your gums and the porcelain are a good match, your gums tolerate the veneers well. </li>
                    <li> Can choose the color of your new teeth. </li>
                    <li> Veneers don't require the amount of prepping that crowns do, making the veneers a more conservative option to a beautiful smile. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong><u>Cons to veneers</u></strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> The process is final, there is no undoing the prep of veneers. There is no going back if you decided you wanted your original teeth. </li>
                    <li> Veneers are not cheap. Typically one veneer can be anywhere from $1000-$2000. On top of that, veneers are not covered by most dental insurances. Insurances typically don't cover veneers due to their cosmetic nature. </li>
                    <li> There is no fixing a veneer if it gets cracked or a large chip in it. In those cases, you would have to have a whole new veneer made.</li>
                    <li> Because the process of a veneer does involve removing some of the tooth structure, you are more likely to have sensitivity to hot or cold after you get the veneers put on. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Veneers are a great way to improve your smile, leading to greater self-esteem. If you or someone you know is thinking of getting veneers, give Dr. Fattahi and his wonderful staff at Hamilton Dental Group a call! They will take a look and get you a smile you've always dreamed of! </p>

                        that are bonded to the front surfaces of teeth to whiten 
                        teeth, close spaces, straighten teeth, or repair chipped 
                        or worn teeth. The veneers are only about 1 mm thick (the 
                        thickness of a fingernail). That same thickness is &quot;shaved&quot; 
                        off the natural tooth surface so when the veneer is bonded 
                        to the tooth, the tooth doesn't feel or look &quot;thicker&quot;.
