                  <p>Have you heard of getting a full mouth reconstruction? What about full mouth rehabilitation or full mouth restoration? All three of these mean the same thing; the rebuilding or restoring of most, if not all of the teeth on both the upper and lower jaws. A full mouth reconstruction typically involves your general, family dentist but could also involve dental specialists such as periodontists, oral surgeons, orthodontists, and endodontists. </p>
                  <p>Why would someone need a full mouth reconstruction performed?</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Loss of teeth due to decay or trauma such as car accidents, etc </li>
                    <li> Teeth that have been severely worn down as a result of acid erosion (from food, drinks, acid reflux and eating disorders such as bulimia) or clenching and grinding of the teeth</li>
                    <li> Jaw issues that compromise bite occlusion causing muscle pain and headaches</li>
                    <li> Patients born with conditions such as Ectodermal Dysplasia, Ameliogenesis, or Dentinogenisis Imperfecta that will need extensive restoration of their teeth </li>
                    <li> Former drug use and addiction that has destroyed the teeth</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p> Before anything can be done you need to get an appointment with your family doctor for a complete exam and xrays. (In this case Dr Fattahi).  Dr Fattahi will evaluate your mouth and take x-rays to then determine what treatment options would be best for your personal needs and desires. From there Dr Fattahi and his staff will go over your customized treatment plan where any questions you might have would be addressed. </p>
                  <p>Once treatment is decided on, the next step is to get started with treatment! Since every full mouth reconstruction is different, there is no defined second step besides getting the work started. A qualified dentist and his/her staff will be able to guide you with steps (first, second, third, etc appointments) and timelines. </p>
                  <p>What are the benefits to going through a full mouth reconstruction? For starters, a full mouth reconstruction is completely customized to you and your needs and wants. A full mouth restoration will also improve your not only your dental useage (including improving your ability to chew foods) but also your self confidence as your teeth have changed and improved esthetically as well. </p>
                  <p>What about any downsides or risks to having a full mouth reconstruction done? For starters, a full mouth reconstruction typically takes months, sometimes even years to complete. (Typically, longer time frames include orthodontics such as braces or orthodontic trays such as Clear Correct or Invisalign.) Another disadvantage to a full mouth reconstruction is that depending on the course of treatment, can become an expensive adventure. If you are interested in getting a full mouth reconstruction, make sure to see how you insurance will pay and if your office offers any financing (Care Credit, in office payment plans, cash discount, etc).</p>
                  <p> I've heard a lot about a smile makeover. Is it the same as a full mouth reconstruction? While the two procedures have similarities and can involve the same procedures, they are different. While a full mouth reconstruction rebuilds, restores and/or replaces most or all of the teeth in the mouth, a smile makeover is done for cosmetic reasons. </p>
                  <p>If you are wanting to improve not only your oral health but also function, consider a full mouth reconstructive treatment! Give the staff at Hamilton Dental Group a call to schedule your exam with Dr Fattahi to see if you are a good candidate for a full mouth reconstruction.</p>
                  <p>Full Mouth Reconstruction is the optimal choice when several 
                    teeth are decayed or missing, affecting the occlusion (the 
                    way the teeth come together) and/or the appearance of the 
                    face. Full Mouth Reconstruction may involve bridges, veneers, 
                    and/or crowns. Most of the existing teeth require treatment 
                    in order to correct and restore balance to the occlusion (bite) 
                    and facial features.</p>
